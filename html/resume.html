          Working in the Advanced Forestry Systems group to develop applications for extracting timber inventory data from the Forest Management System (FMS) and processing this data through various biometrics processes. FMS is a third-party system that allows users to view and edit timber inventory data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ongoing maintenance and development for a series of tools used for processing LiDAR data with the goal of updating data in the timber inventory system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most work is done in C# with embedded SQL for accessing a SQL Server database.

          Ongoing maintenance and enhancements for the Resource Management System (RMS). RMS is an enterprise GIS that is designed to assist forest managers in planning and decision making in their efforts to manage tree farms for maximum profit while satisfying environmental and animal habitat concerns. RMS as it currently exists is written in a mixture of C#/.NET and un-managed C++. It consists of approximately 60 separate executables, DLLs and static libraries. All spatial and tabular data is stored in an Oracle database using ESRI ArcGIS and SDE as the commercial GIS component. While initial development for RMS has long since been completed, ongoing maintenance, enhancements and necessary upgrades due to newer technology remain a challenging issue with a smaller and smaller development staff.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Major enhancements/upgrades for RMS include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Switching from file-based spatial data storage (coverages) to using spatial data stored in Oracle as SDE feature classes.</li>
          <li>Switching tabular data entry forms from a mixture of PowerBuilder forms and C++ forms using MFC to generic metadata-driven C#/.NET forms using the DataGridView class.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Developed tools for managing and manipulating LiDAR data files (*.las) and LiDAR-derived raster products.  These tools are written in C# and include a UI also written in C#.
        </p>
        <p>
          Received a Weyerhaeuser Company President's Award in early 2011 for work with LiDAR data.

          Developed and installed the graphical/coordinate portion of the Block Management System. Trained approximately 90 users at several locations.  This portion of the system comprises approximately 60,000 lines of C and 80x86 Assembler code.  BMS is a DOS-based PC Geographic Information System that utilizes inventory data to assist forest managers with planning and decision making.  Other uses include tracking silvicultural treatments and various environmentally sensitive areas.  This data is then uploaded to the mainframe database of record (FIRS).
        </p>
        <p>
          Developed a significant portion of the Timberlands Cruise System.  TCS is a data-gathering system for use on a hand-held data-recorder.  It consists of approximately 3,000 lines of C code on both the data-recorder and the PC host system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developed the Sales Data Collection addition to the Washington Log System.  LOGS is a transaction processing system based on an Oracle database and written in C and SQL Forms.
